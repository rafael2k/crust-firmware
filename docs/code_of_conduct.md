# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines expectations for participation in the Crust
Firmware community, which is committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring
community for all. People violating this code of conduct may be banned from the
community.

Our open source community strives to:

* Be friendly and patient: Remember you might not be communicating in someone
  else's primary spoken or programming language, and others may not have your
  level of understanding.
* Be welcoming: Our community welcomes and supports people of all types and
  backgrounds. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race,
  ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and
  economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity
  and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and
  mental and physical ability.
* Be respectful: We are a world-wide community of professionals, and we conduct
  ourselves professionally. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and
  poor manners. Disrespectful and unacceptable behavior includes, but is not
  limited to:
  * Violent threats or language.
  * Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language.
  * Posting gratuitous, sexually explicit or violent material.
  * Posting, or threatening to post, people's personally identifying
    information ("doxing").
  * Insults, especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs.
  * Behavior that could be perceived as unwanted sexual attention.
  * Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.
* Understand disagreements: Disagreements, both social and technical, are
  useful learning opportunities. Seek to understand the other viewpoints and
  resolve differences constructively.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to capture our common
understanding of a productive, collaborative environment. We expect the code to
be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.
