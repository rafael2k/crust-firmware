		Use a serial port (UART) for error logs and debugging.
		Note that depending on the port and options selected,
		this may interfere with other users of that serial port.

		If you are unsure, use the default port and baud rate.

		For maximum power savings, select the R_UART device or
		disable this option entirely.

		If a positive number is entered, the firmware will set
		up the serial port with that baud rate before using it.

		If zero is entered, the firmware will assume the serial
		port is already configured and keep the existing baud
		rate. Use this option if the port is shared with other
		users.
