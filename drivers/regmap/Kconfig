	default I2C_PINS_PL0_PL1
	help
		Choose which pair of pins is used for the I2C bus.

config I2C_PINS_NONE
	bool "None"
	help
		Select this option if your board does not have a PMIC or
		regulator connected via I2C.

		This is usually the right choice if your SoC supports RSB.

config I2C_PINS_PL0_PL1
	bool "PL0/PL1"
	help
		Select this option if your board has a PMIC or regulator
		connected via I2C using the normal set of pins.

		Note that if your SoC contains an RSB controller,
		choosing this option will prevent you from using it.

config I2C_PINS_PL8_PL9
	bool "PL8/PL9"
	depends on HAVE_RSB
	help
		Select this option if your board has a PMIC or regulator
		connected via I2C using the alternate set of pins.

	help
		Provide the pin mode that configures PL0/PL1 as I2C SCL/SDA.

config I2C
