	bool "Poll the GPIO controller for EINT IRQs (DEPRECATED)"
	help
		Check the main GPIO controller (the one containing ports
		A through H) for external interrupts (EINTs) when
		polling for wakeup IRQs.

		This allows EINT-capable pins on those ports to be used
		as wakeup sources. The pins must be configured as EINT
		pins by Linux before entering suspend.

		Note: This option is not needed when using a Linux patch
		set released in 2021. The newer driver plumbs the EINT
		IRQs through to R_INTC.

		Say Y if your board has a device connected to port A-H
		that must be able to wake up or turn on the system, and
		you are using an older kernel. Otherwise, say N.

		bank, counting from 0. This number is not related to the

		bank, counting from 0. This number is not related to the
